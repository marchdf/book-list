The following repository contains several lists pertaining to books: 

- a [chronological](./data/read_books.md) and an [alphabetized](./data/read_books_alpha.md) list of books I have read

- a list of [books that were recommended to me](./data/recommendations.md) and [some random ideas](./data/random.md)

- a list of [books we own but haven't read](./data/unread_books.md)
